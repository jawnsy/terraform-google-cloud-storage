# terraform-google-cloud-storage

This repository is a fork of git@github.com:terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-cloud-storage.git.

I wanted to avoid maintaining the  branch in my fork because:

1. It is traditionally a pristine copy of the upstream repository, which
   can cause confusion 
1. I would have to synchronize it with the upstream repository periodically
   time to time (, )
 since it
would traditionally be a pristine copy
In order to avoid maintaining the  branch in my fork, I configured
my local repository to track the upstream's default branch.
This is [@jawnsy](https://github.com/jawnsy)'s fork of git@github.com:terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-cloud-storage.git.
As I don't want to maintain a main tracking branch, my local repository
is set to track the upstream's default branch.
